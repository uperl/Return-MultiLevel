=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Return::MultiLevel qw(with_return);

  sub inner {
    my ($f) = @_;
    $f->(42);  # implicitly return from 'with_return' below
    print "You don't see this\n";
  }

  sub outer {
    my ($f) = @_;
    inner($f);
    print "You don't see this either\n";
  }

  my $result = with_return {
    my ($return) = @_;
    outer($return);
    die "Not reached";
  };
  print $result, "\n";  # 42

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides a way to return immediately from a deeply nested call
stack. This is similar to exceptions, but exceptions don't stop automatically
at a target frame (and they can be caught by intermediate stack frames using
L<C<eval>|perlfunc/eval-EXPR>). In other words, this is more like
L<setjmp(3)>/L<longjmp(3)> than L<C<die>|perlfunc/die-LIST>.

Another way to think about it is that the "multi-level return" coderef
represents a single-use/upward-only continuation.

=head2 Functions

The following functions are available (and can be imported on demand).

=over

=item with_return BLOCK

Executes I<BLOCK>, passing it a code reference (called C<$return> in this
description) as a single argument. Returns whatever I<BLOCK> returns.

If C<$return> is called, it causes an immediate return from C<with_return>. Any
arguments passed to C<$return> become C<with_return>'s return value (if
C<with_return> is in scalar context, it will return the last argument passed to
C<$return>).

It is an error to invoke C<$return> after its surrounding I<BLOCK> has finished
executing. In particular, it is an error to call C<$return> twice.

=back

=head1 DEBUGGING

This module uses L<C<unwind>|Scope::Upper/unwind> from
L<C<Scope::Upper>|Scope::Upper> to do its work. If
L<C<Scope::Upper>|Scope::Upper> is not available, it substitutes its own pure
Perl implementation. You can force the pure Perl version to be used regardless
by setting the environment variable C<RETURN_MULTILEVEL_PP> to 1.

If you get the error message C<Attempt to re-enter dead call frame>, that means
something has called a C<$return> from outside of its C<with_return { ... }>
block. You can get a stack trace of where that C<with_return> was by setting
the environment variable C<RETURN_MULTILEVEL_DEBUG> to 1.

=head1 CAVEATS

You can't use this module to return across implicit function calls, such as
signal handlers (like C<$SIG{ALRM}>) or destructors (C<sub DESTROY { ... }>).
These are invoked automatically by perl and not part of the normal call chain.
